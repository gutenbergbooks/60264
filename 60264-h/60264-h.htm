/></span>T this time, when every Nation in</i> Europe <i>is under the melancholy
Apprehension of an approaching Plague or Pestilence, I think it the
Business of every Man to contribute, to the utmost of his Capacity, such
Observations, as may tend to the Service of the Publick. Upon this foot,
I have some Months since published my Thoughts of the Plague in general,
upon an Hypo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>thesis which many of the Learned concur with, tho’ some few
dissent from it: However, I find, that the Remedies prescribed by the
Physicians of both Opinions, are little different from each other. It is
remark’d by several Learned Men abroad, that Coffee is of excellent Use
in the time of Pestilence, and contributes greatly to prevent the
spreading of Infection: And one of them, in a Letter to me, observes,
that in some Parts of</i> Turkey, <i>where the Plague is almost constant, it
is seldom mortal in those Families, who are rich enough to enjoy the
free Use of Coffee, but that the Poorer Sort, who want that Benefit,
seldom escape. Again, the same Person observes, that Coffee is not
subject to be destroy’d by any Insect, or is subject to rot, as most
other Seeds or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> Grains will do; and therefore justly concludes, that it
is of great Virtue and Use in all Distempers, which are supposed to be
occasioned by Insects, or unwholesome Air. And it is likely, if the true
Virtue and Use of Coffee had been known in</i> London <i>in the Year 1665,
when the Plague raged there, that Dr.</i> Hodges, <i>and other Learned Men of
that time, would have recommended it. But since it is now become a
Liquor known to most people, I have thought fit to republish its
History, with several Additions and Remarks; especially how far it is
useful in Pestilential Cases, with an Account of the best Method of
roasting the Berries, and preserving them after roasting: And for the
Satisfaction of the Curious, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> prefix’d a Figure of the Tree,
Flower, and Fruit, which I delineated from a growing Tree in the</i>
Amsterdam <i>Gardens.</i></p>

<span class="letra2"><img src="images/ill_c.jpg"

<i>Holland</i>, and other Parts of <i>Europe</i>, that I need say little to
recommend its History to the World: The general Use of it rather seems
to command this Work, that by our having a more familiar Knowledge of
it, we may relish it the better. And again, what yet prompts me further
to this Undertaking, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> Opportunity I have at this time to present
the World with a perfect Figure of the <i>Tree</i> that produces this
celebrated <i>Fruit</i>; which is not done here by any random Guess, or
according to the uncertain Report of others, but drawn by my own Hand
from a growing Tree.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">AND</span> that I may observe some sort of Method in the Prosecution of my
Discourse, I shall, in the first place, give my Reader the Names and
Descriptions of it, from the several Authors who have mentioned it; and
then I shall offer a more exact Account, from my own Knowledge, of the
<i>Plant</i>, <i>Flower</i>, and <i>Fruit</i>, for the better understanding of the
aforesaid Figure: after which, I shall set down the Time and Manner of
its first Appearance in <i>England</i>, with its Virtues and Uses. To which I
shall add some necessary Observations relating to the Original Place of
its Growth, and Manner of Trading for it; and conclude with some Remarks
I have made of its Culture in the <i>Amsterdam</i> Garden.</p>

<p class="spc1"><i><span class="spc">JACOB COTOVICUS</span></i>, in his Travels to <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Anno 1598.</i> mentions
the <i>Coffee</i> to have been at that time a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> Drink much in use amongst the
<i>Turks</i>; and tells us, that some of the <i>Arabians</i> called it <i>Cahua</i>,
and others <i>Bunnu</i> and <i>Bunchi</i>, but gives us no Description of the
Plant. He is the first Author that I find to have mentioned this Liquor.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc"><i>PROSPER ALPINUS</i></span>, a Physician of <i>Venice</i>, in his Book of <i>Egyptian
Plants</i>, makes mention of the <i>Tree</i>, and gives us an imperfect Cut of
it: He tells us, that he first saw it in a Garden belonging to a Captain
of the Janizaries at <i>Grand Cairo</i>, brought from <i>Arabia Felix</i>, and
planted there as a great Rarity: It is, saith he, like the <i>Euonymus</i> or
<i>Prickle-Timber</i>, but with Leaves thicker, harder, and greener. Of the
Fruit (called <i>Buna</i>) the <i>Turks</i> and <i>Arabs</i> make a Decoction or Drink,
which they use instead of Wine, and is called <i>Coava</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><i><span class="spc">PALUDAMUS</span></i>, after him, mentions it by the Name of <i>Choava</i>; and
<i>Rauwolfius</i> calls it <i>Chaube</i>; but neither of them do make any Remarks
upon it, that are worthy to be communicated to my Reader; for these
Authors writ near a hundred Years since, when <i>Coffee</i> was little known
to the <i>Europeans</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><i><span class="spc">SANDYS</span></i>, in his Travels through the <i>Turkish</i> Empire, met with this
Drink at <i>Constantinople</i>: He says, “It was sold in many publick Places
there, which he calls <i>Coffa-Houses</i>, where the <i>Turks</i> sit chatting
most of the Day, and sip of a Drink called <i>Coffa</i>, in little China
Dishes, as hot as they can suffer it; black as Soot, and tasting not
much unlike it.” He believes it to be that black Broth, which was in use
amongst the <i>Lacedemonians</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><i><span class="spc">PARKINSON</span></i>, in his <i>Theatr. Botanic.</i> <i>pag. 1622.</i> gives us a very
indifferent Figure of it, calling the <i>Tree</i>, <i>Arbor Bon</i>, and tells us,
the <i>Fruit</i> is somewhat larger than a Hazel-Nut, pointed at the
Extremities, and of a greyish Ash-Colour; that each Berry contains two
white Seeds, which the <i>Turks</i> make Drink of, and is in great Esteem
amongst them.</p>

<p class="spc1"><i><span class="spc">JOHN BAUHINE</span></i> calls it <i>Bon</i> vel <i>Ban Arbor</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><i><span class="spc">CASPER BAUHINE</span></i> describes it thus; <i>Euonymo Similis Ægyptica fructu
Baccis Lauri simili</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="smcap"><span class="spc">Mr.</span></span> <i><span class="spc">RAY</span></i>, in his <i>Histor. Plantar.</i> <i>pag. 1691.</i> calls it <i>Coffee
Frutex</i>, <i>ex cujus Fructu fit Potus</i>. He had not seen the <i>Plant</i>, but
discourses largely on its Virtues, which I shall give an Account of in
the proper Place.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">MONSIEUR</span> <i><span class="spc">PONCETT</span></i>, in his Voyage to <i>Æthiopia</i>, makes it a Native of
that Country; it was, as he says, transplanted from thence to <i>Arabia
Felix</i>, and at this time the <i>Æthiopians</i> cultivate it only as a
Curiosity: he describes it to be like the <i>Myrtle</i> in its Leaves, but
larger and tufted; the <i>Fruit</i> like <i>Pistachio</i> Nut, green at first, and
of a darker Colour when it is ripe: and this they call <i>Coffee</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">MANY</span> others have mentioned the <i>Fruit</i> to be of a <i>Citron</i> Colour, and
of a Greyish White: but it appears plain to me, they have never seen it
in its Prosperity, as I have done; of which my Reader may be satisfied,
when he compares such Accounts with the Description I shall give of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc"><span class="smcap">Dr.</span></span> <i><span class="spc">COMELIN</span></i>, <i>Botanick</i> Professor at <i>Amsterdam</i>, in his Lectures on
<i>Plants</i>, places this <i>Tree</i> among the <i>Jessamines</i>, and compares the
Leaf to that of our common <i>Chesnut</i>; but as that Gentleman has not yet
printed any Account of it, I shall not therefore attempt to publish the
Name at large, which he has given it. He is undoubtedly in the right to
class it with the <i>Jessamines</i>; but I rather join in Opinion with my
learned Friend Mr. <i>Petiver</i>, that the Leaf is more like to that of the
<i>Laurus Vulgaris</i>, or common <i>Bay</i>, but larger.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THUS</span> having given a View of what has been mentioned by the several
Authors concerning the Name and Description of this <i>Tree</i>, I shall
proceed to describe it from the Knowledge I have of it.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">IN</span> the <i>Physick-Garden</i> of <i>Amsterdam</i> are two <i>Coffee-Trees</i> above
seventeen foot high, which have been for some time in a bearing State,
and have, at most Seasons, <i>Fruit</i> upon them; from one of these <i>Trees</i>
I design’d the Figure prefix’d to this Treatise, which in every Point
re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span>sembles the Branch I took it from, except only the Size, which ought
to be one third part bigger to make it equal with the Life.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> <i>Tree</i> is of very quick Growth, and naturally inclinable to shoot
upright; ’tis reported, that in its native Country it generally attains
to the height of forty or fifty foot, although the Stem, in the thickest
part, does not exceed five Inches in Diameter. The Leaves are
Bi-composite (or set in cross Pairs at the Joints) and not unlike those
of the common <i>Bay</i>, but curl’d at the Edges, and inclinable to hang
down. The <i>Flowers</i> put forth in Clusters at the Joints, towards the
Extremities of the Branches; they make their first Appearance in <i>July</i>,
and are in Figure, Size, and Colour the same with those of the common
<i>Jessamine</i>, with the Addition only of five yellow <i>Apices</i>, which hang
loosely on the Top of the Flower, and a <i>Style</i> which projects near half
an Inch above it: their Smell is faint, and little worth our Notice.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">ABOUT</span> <i>October</i> these Trees have done blowing, and then the Green Fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span>
appear, which hang on them till the <i>July</i> following before they are
ripe; they resemble at that time the Berries of the <i>Lauro-Cerasus</i>, or
<i>Bay-Cherry</i>, and are much of the same Shape and Colour (<i>i.e.</i> of a
dark Red) but instead of a single Stone, these have two Kernels, which
split in the middle like the <i>Bay-berries</i> of the <i>Shops</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> <i>Fruit</i> being come to its Perfection, is gathered and prepared
either for making Drink, or for propagating other Plants. For the first
of these Uses they are spread on Mats, in the open Sun, to dry and
harden, which requires some time to accomplish; they are afterwards
rolled to and fro in rough Baskets to get off the Husks, and then tost
in an airy Place to clean them. Being thus ordered, they are ready for
the Roaster, who fits them for our Use.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">MONSIEUR <i>BERNIER</i></span> tells us, that in the roasting of the Berries chiefly
depends the Goodness of the Liquor; and affirms, that at <i>Grand Cairo</i>,
(where there were above a thousand <i>Coffee-Houses</i>) there was but two
Persons who rightly understood that Art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1">I <span class="spc">HAVE</span> taken some pains to experience the best Method of roasting it,
and find none so good as by an Iron Vessel made to turn on a Spit, and
it may be roasted before a clear Fire, or over a Charcoal Fire: and here
every Berry has an equal share of Heat; and I like it roasted in a
middle way, not overburnt. I would recommend therefore the roasting of
it to every particular Family in <i>England</i>, they being then most secure
from having any damaged Berries, or any Art used to increase the Weight,
which is very injurious to the Drinkers of Coffee. Most Persons of
Distinction in <i>Holland</i> roast their own Berries.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">MONSIEUR <i>DU FOUR</i></span>, a Merchant of <i>Lyons</i>, in his Treatise of this
Liquor, recommends to us, that the Decoction be prepared in <i>Earthen</i> or
<i>Stone</i> Vessels, as preferable to those of <i>Tin</i>, <i>Copper</i>, or any other
Metal; which (says he) take from it much of its Flavour and Goodness.
And an ingenious Friend of mine observes, that Boiling of it evaporates
too much the fine Spirits; for which reason he advises us to pour
boiling Water upon the Powder, and let it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span> stand to infuse four or five
Minutes before the Fire: and this Method, in my Judgment, much exceeds
the common way of preparing it.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">SOME</span> of the most curious Coffee-drinkers have informed me, that as soon
as they have reduced the Berries to Powder, ’tis the best way to put the
fresh-ground Coffee into the Coffee-Pot, which should be either of Stone
or Silver; and let it stand over the Fire a Minute or two, before they
pour the Water upon it: Others, who have not the Opportunity of getting
their Berries fresh roasted, recommend the drying and warming them
before the Fire, immediately before they grind them. And indeed both
these ways I find contribute greatly to the good Flavour of the Liquor;
but whether we prepare this Liquor by Decoction or Infusion, it commonly
remains thick and troubled for some Minutes after it is made, unless we
pour into it a Spoonful or two of cold Water, which immediately
precipitates the more heavy Parts to the bottom, and renders it clear
enough for drinking. In travelling I have often found my Account in
packing the Powder of fresh-roasted Coffee in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> Bottles, which for more
than twenty days has preserved its Strength and Goodness; which I
mention for the sake of those who have been so much used to drink Coffee
in the Morning, that they have not their Health without it, or have been
forced to take up with ill-tasted damaged Stuff in some Country Village.
I am the more careful to make this Remark, because I have sometimes been
a Sufferer on this Account, and I would advance, as much as possible,
the Content of Mankind.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> first Knowledge and Use of <i>Coffee</i> is not certainly known; but,
according to <i>Banesius</i>, it was discovered by mere Accident: He tells
us, “It is the common Tradition amongst the <i>Eastern</i> People, that a
certain Keeper of Camels or Goats in <i>Arabia Felix</i>, complained to the
Religious of a Monastery in those Parts, that his Herds, twice or thrice
a Week, not only kept awake all Night long, but spent it in frisking and
dancing in an unusual manner. The Prior of the Monastery, led by his
Curiosity, and weighing the Matter, believed that this must happen from
the Food of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> Creatures. Marking therefore diligently that very
Night, in company with one of his Monks, the very Place where the Goats
or Camels pastured, when they danced; found there certain Shrubs or
Bushes, on the Fruit of Berries, of which they fed. He resolved to try
the Virtues of these Berries himself; thereupon boiling them in Water,
and drinking thereof, he found, by Experience, it kept him awake in the
Night. Hence it happened that he enjoined those of his Monastery the
daily Use of it; for this procuring Watchfulness, made them more readily
and surely attend their Devotions, which they were obliged to perform in
the Night. When by this frequent use of it, they daily experienced its
Wholesomness, and how effectually it conduced to the preserving them in
perfect Health, the Drink grew in request throughout the whole Kingdom;
and, in progress of time, other Nations and Provinces of the <i>East</i> fell
into the use of it.”<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THIS</span> Story may very likely have given rise to that Opinion so generally
receiv’d amongst the <i>Italians</i>, That the Use of <i>Coffee</i> was first
discover’d and brought out of <i>Asia</i> into <i>Europe</i> by some <i>Fryers</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> same Author mentions, “That some among the <i>Turks</i>, in a sort of
Thankfulness to these Monks, have sett and peculiar daily Orisons for
<i>Sciadly</i> and <i>Aidrus</i>, which they believe are the Names of the Monks
beforemention’d.”</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">BUT</span> it is a more receiv’d Opinion throughout the <i>Turkish Empire</i>, that
an <i>Angel</i> taught the Use of this <i>Coffee-Drink</i> to a <i>Mussel-man</i>, or
true Believer: however, of this we are certain, the Use of it was not
known in <i>England</i>, till the Year 1657; at which time Mr. <i>Daniel
Edwards</i>, a <i>Turkey</i>-Merchant, in his Return from <i>Smyrna</i> to <i>London</i>,
brought over with him one <i>Pasqua Rosee</i>, a <i>Ragusean Greek</i>, who was
used to prepare this Liquor for him every Morning: The Novelty of it
drew so great Resort to his House, that he lost all the Fore-part<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span> of
the Day by it; insomuch that he thought it expedient to rid himself of
this Trouble, by allowing his <i>Greek</i> Servant (in conjunction with his
Son-in-law’s <i>Coachman</i>) to make and sell it publickly. They set up
their <i>Coffee-House</i> in <i>St. Michael’s Alley</i> in <i>Cornhill</i>, which was
the first in <i>London</i>. But some small time after, these Partners fell
out and parted; and the <i>Coachman</i> got leave to pitch a <i>Tent</i> in <i>St.
Michael</i>’s Church-yard, and there to sell his <i>Coffee</i> in opposition to
<i>Pasqua</i>, as appears by a Letter written at that time by a curious
Gentleman, who lately communicated it to me.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">AND</span> thus was the Use of <i>Coffee</i> first introduced amongst us. The
Cheapness of it, with the Conveniencies in this Way of meeting (being
preferable to those in Taverns and Ale-Houses) soon increas’d its
Drinkers; and other <i>Coffee-Houses</i> were set up in most Parts of the
Kingdom: so that, in a few Years, it did not only gain a general Esteem
with us, but also became one of the most valuable Commodities imported
by the <i>East-India</i> and <i>Turkey</i> Companies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">WE</span> may here observe, That King <i>Charles</i> II. finding the daily Increase
of <i>Coffee-Houses</i>, and that at those Places People were apt to talk too
freely of the State, endeavour’d the suppressing of them: but the Judges
being consulted, they declared it could not be done by Law; and only
ended in laying a Tax on them.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">OF</span> <i>its Vertues</i>; It is noted, That the <i>Arabs</i>, and others of the
<i>Eastern</i> People, in the Summer-Season, use only a Decoction made of the
outside Husks of this <i>Fruit</i>; and in the cooler Seasons make use of the
Kernels, esteeming the first to be cooling, and the other to be of a
hotter Nature. <i>Veslingius</i> seems to be of their opinion, in his Notes
on <i>Alpinus</i>, where he tells us, The Husk and Kernel of this <i>Berry</i>
have different Qualities; the first he esteems cold and dry, and the
latter to be moderately warm: And this Assertion is likewise confirm’d
to us, by <i>Peter de la Valle</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1">Dr. <i>Lemery</i> of <i>Paris</i>, speaking of <i>Coffee</i>, as it is in use amongst
the <i>Europeans</i>, tells us, It is of an excellent drying Quality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span>
comforts the Brain, and dries up Crudities in the Stomach. Mr. <i>Ray</i>
mentions it to be of singular Use and Efficacy to such as are afflicted
with Pains in the <i>Head</i>, <i>Vertigo</i>, <i>Lethargy</i>, and <i>Coughs</i>: it has a
good Effect on <i>moist</i> and <i>cold Constitutions</i>; but on the other hand,
he disallows the Use of it to such as are Paralytick, and likewise such
as are troubled with <i>Melancholy Vapours</i>, or have <i>Hot Brains</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">OTHER</span> Authors assert, it cures <i>Consumptions</i>, <i>Swooning Fits</i>, and the
<i>Rickets</i>; and that it helps <i>Digestion</i>, rarefies the <i>Blood</i>,
suppresses <i>Vapours</i>, gives Life and Gayety to the <i>Spirits</i>, prevents
<i>Sleepiness</i> after eating, provokes <i>Urine</i> and the <i>Catamena</i>. The
<i>Arabian</i> Women drink this Liquor constantly in their Periodical Visits,
and find a good Effect from it. It contracts the <i>Bowels</i>, and confirms
the <i>Tone</i> of the Parts, being drank after Victuals, provided it be
fresh made; for if it stands but two or three Hours, it loseth much of
its Virtue. It is prevalent in such as have <i>Running-Humours</i>, <i>Sores</i>,
or <i>King’s-Evil</i>. It is an effectual Remedy against <i>Worms</i> in Children;
so that if the Mother drinks fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span>quently of it when she is With-Child,
the Infant will not be troubled with Worms, during its first Years. ’Tis
allowed to be a strong <i>Antihypnotick</i>, greatly dissipating <i>sleepy
Vapours</i>, and <i>Fumes</i> of <i>Wine</i>. ’Tis likewise useful to such as are
afflicted with <i>Rheumatick</i> or <i>Gouty Humours</i>. The <i>Dutch</i> Physicians
commend the Use of it in <i>Intermitting Fevers</i>, and hold it to be good
against <i>Infection</i>; because of the great Refreshment it gives the
nobler Parts of the Body, and its sudden Effect upon the Spirits, which
are wonderfully recreated by it. And it is apparently the Opinion of all
Physicians who have yet wrote concerning the Plague, That such Bodies
whose Spirits are the most overcome by Fear, are the most subject to
receive Infections. And again, That the Spirits must be refresh’d only
by such Liquors, or Preparations, as will not promote Inflammations. And
of this nature, <i>say they</i>, is Coffee, which by a right Use supports the
vital Flame, and defends the Body from Pestilential Infection. And as
such it is generally recommended, as a necessary Drink, at least twice a
day; the first thing in a Morning, and at four in the Afternoon. Now
whether the Hypo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span>thesis of venomous Animalcula brought by the Air, or
that of Aerial Atoms, poison’d and rendred unwholesom, be the Cause of
the Pestilence, will be examin’d in another Work; but at present I shall
only say, That most of the Physicians, of both Sects, prescribe the same
Methods of Prevention, and of Cure.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">IT</span> has been remark’d by several eminent Men, That in the Countries of
the <i>East</i>, where this Liquor is drank plentifully, the Inhabitants of
those Parts are seldom or never troubled with the Stone, Gout, or
Dropsy; which Distempers they imagine to be subdu’d by the powerful
Virtue of this Decoction: but whether this Drink be proper for such as
are afflicted with the Stone, I shall leave to the Judgment of the
Learned, after they have read the following Relation, which I had from a
Gentleman of <i>Leyden</i>, and what I believe may be depended upon: A Person
of that University prepared two Gallons of Coffee-Drink, after the rate
of eight Ounces of Powder to a Gallon of Water, and drew a Spirit from
it, and again distilled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> that Spirit another, which he set by in
his Study, till he could find some Opportunity to try its Effects. About
eight Months pass’d before he had any Occasion to make use of it, when,
to his great Surprize, he found at the bottom of the Bottle a
Crustaceous or Petrified Matter, so very hard, and so strongly cemented
together, that, notwithstanding his great Skill in Chymistry, he was not
able to dissolve it. And this Case (I think) may well admit of farther
Enquiry, and more especially if we consider the Volatile Spirits
contain’d in Coffee to be one fourth part of the Weight of it, which
appears by so much Loss in the common Way of roasting the Berries.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">I SHALL</span> now proceed to give an Account of the Country it comes from,
with some Observations relating to the Mercantine Part.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THAT</span> curious Gentleman, <i>Robert Balle</i> Esq; furnish’d me with the
following Relation, as he had it from a Person that had been upon the
Place, and seen it grow: Coffee, <i>says he</i>, is not known<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> to grow
naturally in any Part of the World, but only in <i>Arabia Felix</i>, some few
Days Journey Inland from <i>Moco</i>, in the Valleys of the <i>Great
Mountains</i>, and near the City <i>Saana</i>, about twenty Degrees
North-Latitude: The Prince of which, about eighty Years since, beat the
<i>Turks</i> in a Battel near that Place, freed himself from their Yoke under
which he was before, and made himself Independent as at this Day,
permitting great Freedom of Trade to all Nations.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">I SHALL</span> here take occasion to remark, wherein lies the Difference
between what we call <i>Turkey</i> and <i>India Coffee</i>, and why the latter has
not been esteemed so good as that we receive from <i>Turkey</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> first of these is bought by the <i>Turks Merchants</i>, who go up into
the Country where it grows, and there contract for the Fruit of Gardens,
or so many Trees as they have occasion for, (as our Fruit-mongers do for
Cherries in <i>Kent</i>.) When it is gathered and prepared, as I have already
mentioned, they bring it upon Camels down to <i>Juda</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> Port at the
bottom of the <i>Red-Sea</i> (which is the Port to <i>Grand Cairo</i>) to be
transported to <i>Suez</i>; from thence by Land, about seventy Miles, to
<i>Grand Cairo</i>, and so down the <i>Nile</i> to <i>Alexandria</i>, where it is
ship’d off for <i>Asia</i> or <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THERE</span> commonly comes thus every Year to <i>Egypt</i>, from sixty to seventy
thousand Bales of <i>Coffee</i>; which may contain, one with the other, about
three hundred weight each.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> Bashaw of <i>Cairo</i> sets a Price upon it, according to its Abundance
or Scarcity, and the People there make use of it as Money in the Market,
counting so many Berries to an <a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>Asper, in proportion to the Value or
Price settled by the Bashaw.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">BUT</span> that Sort, which we have under the Character of <i>India Coffee</i>, is
bought at <i>Bettelfukere</i>, where the <i>English</i>, <i>Dutch</i>, and <i>French</i>, of
late Years, send up Factors to buy the said Commodity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> and bring it on
Camels to <i>Moco</i>, from whence it is shipped for <i>Europe</i>. By which means
(although it is obliged to pass the Line twice) what we now have that
way is little inferiour to <i>Turkey</i>; which was formerly the Refuse, or
what the <i>Turks</i> left at <i>Bettlefukere</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> immense Quantity of this Fruit, which is yearly exported from this
one Country to other Parts of the World, is almost incredible; which, as
we are informed, is computed to be about a Million of Bushels, one Year
with another: and although it may seem unreasonable to believe, that
this Country alone should produce it in so great abundance, (considering
how small a Quantity can be gathered from each single Tree) yet with as
much Surprize we may admire how it is possible, that even the Number of
Bushels I have mentioned should be sufficient to answer the vast Demand
for it; since it is certain, that besides the general Esteem it has
gained all over <i>Europe</i>, it is not less requested throughout <i>Africa</i>
and <i>Asia</i>, to their utmost Bounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">HENCE</span> we may reasonably conjecture what vast Riches must be amass’d by
these <i>Arabs</i>, seeing they are the Proprietors of this Commodity, and
thereby command so great a Part of the Wealth of the most opulent
Countries. This part of <i>Arabia Felix</i> is truly (as Mr. <i>Ray</i> observes)
φερώυμος, and merits the most happy Name for its Fertility in rich
Produce. I admire, continues that Author, how so great a Treasure has
remained so long peculiar to one Country, and that neither the Envy nor
Avarice of its Neighbours have tempted them to share in this great
Advantage! But so prudent are its Masters, that on no account will they
suffer either Plant or Seed of it to come alive out of their Dominions;
taking great care to destroy the germinative Faculty of those Berries
they send abroad, and inflicting the most severe Punishments on such as
shall attempt the Transportation of any Plants of it.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">BUT</span> notwithstanding this their extraordinary Care and Caution to
preserve this Plant peculiar to themselves, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> <i>Hollanders</i>, some
Years ago, found means to furnish themselves with it, and have made a
Plantation of it about <i>Batavia</i>, in the Island of <i>Java</i>, which has
already produced some Tuns of Fruit. From this Plantation they have
lately brought two Trees to <i>Amsterdam</i>, which, by the Skill of their
ingenious Gardiner, flourish and bear Fruit in such Perfection, that
several hundred Plants have been raised there from Seeds, ripened at
that Place; and which, from time to time, they transmit to <i>Surinam</i>,
and such Places in the <i>West-Indies</i> as are in their possession.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THE</span> Heer <i>Gerbrand Pancrass</i>, Commissary of the Garden, and <i>President</i>
of the City of <i>Amsterdam</i>, did me the Honour to accommodate me with
this great Curiosity, which I sent into <i>England</i>, and intrusted to the
care of Mr. <i>Thomas Fairchild</i>, a most accurate Gardiner at <i>Hoxton</i>.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">AND</span> since it has now found its way to <i>England</i>, it may be necessary to
offer some proper Directions for its Culture, agreeable with the Method
observed in the <i>Amsterdam</i> Garden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">WHEN</span> we have an Opportunity to propagate these Trees from the Berries,
we must, immediately after they are gathered, carefully take off the
outside Husk, and separate the two Seeds which are found in each; and
set them an Inch deep in Pots of fine Earth, which are already warm in a
Bed prepared with Horse-litter; keeping the Glasses close covered for
six Weeks, and often sprinkling them with Water. From this way of
Management we may expect them to come up in less than two Months time
after Sowing. And then, for their further Improvement, you are only to
remark, they love Warmth, little Air, a light sandy Earth, and much
Water. And this last Hint answers to an Observation of that Great
Naturalist Sir <i>Hans Sloane</i>; where he tells us, that the <i>Arabians</i> cut
artificial Channels from the Rivers, on purpose to nourish these Plants.
See <i>Philosophical Transactions, Numb. 208. pag. 64.</i></p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">THESE</span> Rules being well observed, we may expect them to bear Fruit in
five Years time from the putting in of the Seed; but in a hotter Clime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span>
such as <i>South-Carolina</i>, or in the <i>Caribbee-Islands</i>, much sooner.</p>

<p class="spc1"><span class="spc">IF</span> the Plague should ever come into <i>England</i> (which God forbid) I
recommend to every Person, when they walk out, that they put in their
Mouth a little Piece of Myrrh, as an excellent Preservative from
receiving any Infection; which I shall treat of more largely in another
Work.</p>
